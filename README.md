# teenytinycompiler

This is an exercise to __rebuild__ a simple compiler that implement a dialect of BASIC. All code here is copied from the following awesome notes of Austin Henley [posts](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html)/[github repo](https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler). Although the majority of the code is the same as the mentioned repository, this is not an identical replica of the code/repo. Some changes compared to the original post are the followings:
- Explicit tests are provided (found in `tests` folder).
- Occasional refactoring as well as python sepcific data structures when it is appropriate. 
- Some aspects of the language might have been expanded. 
- Structure of the code is different from the repository, since I have followed the blog posts instead of the code in the repository. 
- Extra methods or functions that could help with debugging.
